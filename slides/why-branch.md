## Why branch?

So we can work like this:

note:

Working in parallel is tremendously powerful, even for an individual developer. When a critical bug report comes in while you're working on a complex feature, branching allows you to quickly shift focus and deliver a fix, without having to figure out how to reverse and then reconstruct your current work. On a larger team, branching enables you to prepare a release while not impeding developers working on future features.

This illustration depicts just one example of an infinite number of valid workflow designs that branches enable. The important thing is that it is very easy to create, destroy, and merge branches in Git.
