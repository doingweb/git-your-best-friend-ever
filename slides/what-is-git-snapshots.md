## What is Version Control?

Snapshots of your work.

![A simple (single branch) set of snapshots (or "commits") look like a singly-linked list back to the first commit.](images/basic-branching-1.png)

note:

The data structure representing a snapshot is a *commit*.

Do some work, make a commit.

Commits live inside of a *repository*.
