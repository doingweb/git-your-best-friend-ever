## Youâ€™re trying to collaborate on a programming project through Dropbox.

note:

 * Dropbox is really good at sync, but you also need history and control over merges.
 * Can only revert 30 days (or a year if you pay).
 * What do you revert?
 * How do you make it work again?
 * Why did they make a change?
