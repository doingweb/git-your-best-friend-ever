# Branching

note:

Branching is regarded as [one of the top "killer features"](http://coldattic.info/shvedsky/pro/blogs/a-foo-walks-into-a-bar/posts/22) of Git. Its lightweight handling of branches is one of the major ways that Git [set itself apart](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitSvnComparison) from other VCSs.
