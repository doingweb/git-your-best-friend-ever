## Public Projects on GitHub

Contributing to public projects on GitHub and similar services usually goes something like:

<ol>
    <li class="fragment">**Fork** the upstream repository.</li>
    <li class="fragment">**Clone** your fork into your local workspace.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Create a **branch** for your changes.</li>
    <li class="fragment">**Work**!</li>
    <li class="fragment">**Push** back up to your fork.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Keep working and pushing until it's ready.</li>
    <li class="fragment">**Squash** your commits.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Open a **pull request**.</li>
    <li class="fragment">**Participate** in the discussion about your changes, and work through any issues that need to be addressed before it can be merged.</li>
</ol>

note:

Many projects, especially those with a lot of contributions, require contributions to be [squashed](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Squashing-Commits) into a single commit before being merged. This keeps the history readable and makes reverting and cherry-picking a lot easier. Be sure to read the project's contribution guidelines for information like this.

Contribution guidelines are usually in the README or CONTRIBUTING files.
