## Team Projects on GitHub

It's entirely up to the team how they work together, and there are a lot of combinations that work. Here's just one example for a small team:

<ol>
    <li class="fragment">**Clone** the repository into your local workspace.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Create a **branch** for your changes.</li>
    <li class="fragment">**Work**!</li>
    <li class="fragment">**Push** back up to your fork.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Keep working and pushing until it's ready.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Open a **pull request**.</li>
    <li class="fragment">**Participate** in the discussion about your changes, and work through any issues that need to be addressed before it can be merged.</li>
</ol>

note:

There's no fork step, because we assume that every member of the team has push access to the repository.

There's no squash step, because we assume it's more likely that someone else will start basing work on the branch, and changing shared history one of the worst things you can do.

The team may also use the public workflow from the previous slide when they receive pull requests from people outside of the team.

This is how we do https://github.com/refined-bits/refinedbitspodcast.com. It's also how the WSU web team does https://github.com/washingtonstateuniversity/WSU-spine.
