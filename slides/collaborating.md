# Collaborating

note:

Collaborating with Git usually involves doing your work in a branch and having a conversation around merging that branch into the main branch. With GitHub and several other Git applications, this is referred to as a *pull request*. Pull requests are a simple but powerful tool for discussing and critically reviewing changes of any size and keeping distributed development organized.
